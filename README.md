This is a task app that I created using next.js, tailwind, react and mongodb. the app was created with the ability to add tasks as well as update them. the task automatically checks when you update it and provides an updated date. you can provide the name of the task, an in depth desciption, a due date, and a category, as well as a status. the tasks are sorted on the home screen by category and can be edited by clicking on them.
